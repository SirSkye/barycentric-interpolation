# barycentric-interpolation
Pygame implementation of simple barycentric interpolation
# Purpose
Serves to deepen understanding of braycentric interpolation that openGL apparently does automatically.
This is a manual implementation of the interpolation technique. <br>
One significant difference to note is that the coordinate system is the default for pygame - not the normalized coordinate system that openGL uses.
# How does it work?
